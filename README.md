Scala Agents for Reinforcement Learning

This repository will slowly grow over time. It uses Scala and Deep Learning for Java (/Scala) as the ML library (for now anyway, until the Tensorflow Scala offering becomes more mature).

The purpose is to experiment with Reinforcement Learning in a production language and trial new ideas of my own. Of particular interest is reducing the number of trials required to 'solve' a problem to the minimum, humans do not require 100's of trials for simple problems... Making RL commonly available, with clear examples, is the primary objective.

Examples :

1. Implementation of OpenAI gym client in Scala, without external libraries
2. Table (Map actually) based CartPole
3. Simple implementation of CartPole with Neural Net, with very good caracteristics

Much more to come
